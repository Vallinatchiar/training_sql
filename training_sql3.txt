1. Find employees who are in the ‘IT’ department.
Hint: Use INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause filtering dept_name = 'IT'.

emp_id name dept_name
1      Ravi   IT
3      Karan  IT

	select emp_id ,name ,dept_name from employees inner join departments on employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id where department.dept_name='IT'




3. List departments with no employees.
Hint: Use LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN and check for NULL employee IDs.

dept_id dept_name
104     Marketing

	select dept_id ,dept_name from department left join employees on department.dept_id =  employees.dept_id ;
	


4. Show each employee’s name along with every department they could
potentially work in.
Hint: Use CROSS JOIN to get all combinations.

name dept_name
Ravi  IT
Ravi  HR
Ravi  Finance
Ravi  Marketing
Priya IT
...   ...


		select name , dept_name  from employees cross join department;



5. Get all employees and all departments (even if no match).
Hint: Use FULL OUTER JOIN (or UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOIN in MySQL).

name dept_name
Ravi IT
Karan IT
Priya HR
Anjali Finance
Manish
Marketing


 		select name , dept_name fromemployees full outer join departments 		on employees.dept_id = department.dept_id;



6. Find employees who do not belong to any department.
Hint: Use LEFT JOIN and filter where department ID is NULL.
	emp_id  name
	5       Manish


	select emp_id , name from employees left join departments on employees.dept_id = department.dept_id where departments.dept_id == null;
